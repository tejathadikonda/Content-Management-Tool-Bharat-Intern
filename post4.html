                    <strong>Gamma Radiation:</strong> Dr. Bruce Banner, the man behind The Hulk, gained his incredible powers through exposure to gamma radiation. When angered or stressed, he undergoes a transformation into the massive, green-skinned Hulk.

                    <strong>Uncontrollable Rage:</strong> The Hulk's transformations are triggered by intense emotions, particularly anger. While he is a heroic figure, his inability to control his rage makes him a formidable force on the battlefield.
